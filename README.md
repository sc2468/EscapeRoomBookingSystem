# EscapeRoomBookingSystem
This is an escape room booking system written for my personal use in the future. It contains a graphql server and react frontend with contsumes the graphql backend data. 

Reason I chose to use graphql over rest 
* wanted to take advantage of graphql's flexable nature to rappialy change API resonses as I prototype dirrent frontend implemenntation.
* Make sure I am not over featching data from my backend. 
* leverage its self documenting nature to cut down on the ammount of documentation I was required to write.
